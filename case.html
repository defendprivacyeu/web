                <h3>We Are Suing The European Parliament To Get EU AML Laws Annulled.</h3>
                <p>As recognized by the European Court of Human Rights, without privacy, there can be no freedom. Privacy is not a crime – It is a fundamental right, necessary to democracy. Yet, the EU’s anti-money laundering laws place every EU resident under blanket financial surveillance, turning the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' on its head. This significantly undermines our human rights and negatively impacts financial inclusion, leaving the most vulnerable in society behind only to catch less than a fraction of criminal activity.</p>
                <p>Financial privacy should not be sacrificed without thorough impact and efficiency assessments, which the EU has failed to present with the passing of the new AML6 and AMLA. By this, the European Parliament has violated article 5.4 of the Treaty on the European Union, governing the proportionality of laws. This is why we are challenging the EU’s anti-money laundering laws before the Court of Justice of the European Union. International anti-money laundering expert groups, institutions and task forces should commit to respecting TEU’s proportionality and Human Rights laws before getting more of their recommendations applied into law.</p>

                <h3>The EU's AML Laws are Unproportionate and Inefficient in Fighting Crime.</h3>
                <p>Under Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, the principle of Proportionality states that any EU measure must not exceed what is necessary to achieve the desired end, and must not impose a burden on the individual that is excessive in relation to the objective sought to be achieved. Since no impact or Human Rights studies were conducted before the European Parliament’s passing of the new AMLR6 and AMLA, and in light of the fact that the efficiency of AML laws has never been demonstrated – while the risks on Human Rights are real, and no safeguards for protection are set up – the EU’s AML laws do not respect the principle of Proportionality of the European Union.</p>
                <p>The EU’s AML laws are not only proven to be ineffective, but demonstratively put citizens at risk by imposing gigantic personal data collection by private entities, in a time where hacks are getting more frequent, and AI/ML technologies can quickly transform very little information into dangerous decision processes impacting our daily lives without due process.</p>
                <h2>"A recently published work on the effectiveness of European AML policies concludes that while it is possible to estimate what AML policies cost, it is almost impossible to quantify their benefits (Unger et al., 2014: 218)"</h2>

                <h3>The EU's AML Laws Infringe on Our Human Rights.</h3>
                <p>Rights to dignity, self-determination, resistance to oppression… all these rights are currently being trumped by the EU’s AML laws. The presumption of innocence – a pillar of democracy – is reversed, as all EU residents are presumed criminals and surveilled upon, even before behaving in a suspicious way, while surveillance is handed over to private financial institutions, with little to no judicial oversight. As a whole, the AML Laws body is entirely contradictory to the GDPR, setting up data exploitation and requirements that are not compatible with the respect of data privacy, the right to be forgotten, and transparency concerning data processing.</p>
                <h2>„Banking de-risking policies have places ordinary citizens under a general blanket of suspicion and resulted in them being denied bank accounts or having existing bank accounts closed. In addition, banks appear to use these policies to rid themselves of legitimate but less profitable customers, who are often socially at risk. As a result, the implementation of the AML/CFT legal framework as it stands is discriminatory and infringes on the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights of the European Union.“</h2>
